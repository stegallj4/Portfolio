                    In this project, I primarily utilized JavaScript to create a simple form
                    validator that would alert the user to their successes/failures in
                    real time. The script for this employed a number of techniques
                    including Regular Expressions, DOM Manipulation, and Event Listeners.

                    This site was created as practice in creating a responsive website
                    design through CSS Flexbox and Media Queuries. There is no
                    JavaScript connected with this site, therefore none of the buttons or links
                    will do anything or take you anywhere, however, the site design itself is responsive
                    to nearly any shape or size window on a desktop.<br /><span

                    during the "JavaScript Fundamentals" course. In order to preserve
                    academic integrity for all future and current students, the

                    JavaScript techniques such as Event Listeners and DOM Manipulation
                    were used in the creation of this site, please feel free to email me

                    This site was the first of my personal projects that I put together.
                    Utilizing CSS Flexbox and Media Queries, this admin site is fully
                    responsive for any window shape or size on a desktop. With a
                    combination of over 300 lines of HTML, 700 lines of CSS, and only 33
                    lines of JavaScript, DOM Manipulation and Event Listeners were
                    employed to create a seamless transition from Light to Dark Mode.
